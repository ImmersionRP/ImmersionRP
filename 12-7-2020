Small Server Update. 



Recently after having several scripts to stop working along with multiple crashes our team did some extensive testing narrowing the issue down. 

-We performed a server rebuild and re-uploaded everything in hopes this would iron out the issues. 
So far so good. Everything seems to be working smoothly again, even the pocket system. 

-Updated the pocket system from chat command to Hotkey F2 press. 

-Our team is working on Shops coordinates and an items database for the items and shops that will be in the city.

-Server Applications will soon be changing along with the questions and city rules. (A complete rebuild of the current ones so keep your eye out. An announcement will be made when this happens)

-The Server URL " ImmersionRP.com"  has officially finished transferring ownership over to us. New Web host and website updates are soon to follow.


As development continues we urge you to express your thoughts, opinions, & suggestions to us. Feel free to post in the correct channels in the discord! 
If you have any questions feel free to contact a member from our staff team.

Thank you all again for remaining patient with us. We are working continuously hard in hopes to make an awesome city!
